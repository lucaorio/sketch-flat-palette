**Sketch Flat Palette** is a simple, flat color palette. Useful when starting new projects, or to overwrite your *Sketch global colors* in case of hard disk wipes (perhaps you're too busy to manually overwrite them ðŸ™ƒ).

## Installation & Usage
There are two different palettes included in the `flat-palette` folder.

#### Sketch Palettes Version
To use the `.sketchpalette` version, install [SketchPalettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes), and import the palette from the `Plugins -> Sketch Palettes -> Load Palette...` dropdown menu.
